	<p>Hello world, my name is <span style="color:red">Alvida Carter</span> and I've had a very long road in my many attempts to partake in this journey called 'Wed Development'. I am currently working for <a href="https://business.comcast.com/">Comcast's Business Services Department</a> as a <strong>Web Content Editor</strong> and I couldn't be more thrilled to be attending this NYCDA Web Development class.</p>

	<p>While in <a href="www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Design School</a> I took <strong>numerous courses in web design,</strong> but at the time of my graduation the market shifted, so sad to say I took the first opportunity that came my way. <span style="color: #DAA520"><strong>Thankfully, years later the skies parted and a rainbow appeared</strong> and so here I am having a blast doing what I truly love.</span></p>

	<p>I am confident that <a href="https://nycda.com/learn-to-code-here/">this course</a> will <strong>amplify my contributions</strong> to the projects set before me.</p>

	<h3>So look out world!</h3>
